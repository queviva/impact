        A life-destroying impact crater lies just below the surface of
        what is, now, a nearly flat eroded plain.
        <br><br>
        But, using a gravity anomaly visualization map ...
    </div>
    <div class="migDiv">

    <div>
        ... the forms of this <i>obvious</i> impact crater
        clearly stand out.
        <br><br>
       The magenta-colored, high-gravity,
       arc rim of the outer wall emerges around the blue-green,
       low-gravity areas of the crater's floor.
       An arrow indicates the distinct
       small blue, low-gravity, depression at the center
       of this classic bowl crater.

        Epicentered just off the coast of Chixulu...
        <br><br>
        Ooops - wait a second, that isn't the right picture.
        Let me start again.
        <br><br>
        Ok, <i>here's</i> the correct image:
    </div>
    <div class="migDiv">
        <img src="rawImpact01.jpg">
    </div>
    <div>
        Situated at the edge of the coastline,
        this gravity anomaly map shows
        all of the distinctive features of a classic impact
        crater:
    </div>
    <div class="migDiv">
        <img src="circleImpact01.jpg">
    </div>
    <div>
        The arrow indicates the high-gravity, uplifted area of
        the <i>central peak</i>; a lower-gravity
        <i>inner basin</i> surrounds that,
        leading up to the obvious <i>peak ring</i>.
        <br><br>
        From there, another low-gravity depression forms the
        <i>annular trough</i>, encompassed by the magenta-colored,
        high-gravity of the <i>outer rim</i>.
        <br><br>
        No one could mistake the dramatic features of this reknowned
        impact crater, located near the town of Chixu...
        <br><br>
        Oooh - <i>sorry</i>.  I can't believe this happend again.
        I'm so sorry; this isn't the right image.  Let me find
        the right one.
        <br><br>
        Ok, here it is - this time it's correct.
        Who can argue with this? Nothing could be a more obvious
        impact crater! The blue, low-gravity depression of the crater's
        <i>floor</i> leads inextricably to the surrounding
        <i>terrace</i> walls of the <i>rim</i>.
    </div>
    <div class="migDiv">
        <img src="rawImpact02.jpg">
    </div>
    <div>
        One can also make out the secondary impact from one of the
        <i>disruption fragments</i> - here indicated by an arrow.

        Wait, what? Are you <i>kidding me?!!</i> Who is in charge
        of these slides?!!!
        <br><br>
        One. More. Time. Ok, I got it, I got it.  Look at this:
    </div>
    <div class="migDiv">
        <img src="rawImpact03.jpg">
    </div>
    <div>
        In this gravity anomaly map, a distinctive arc of high-gravity
        surrounds a blue region of low-gravity.
    </div>
    <div class="migDiv">
        <img src="circleImpact03.jpg">
    </div>
    <div>
        What is, unmistakeably,
        the site of an impact crater just off the coast of the
        small town of Chix ...
        <br><br>
        ARE YOU <b>KIDDING</b> ME?!!!
        <br><br>
        Wow - so, <i>none</i> of these is from anywhere near
        that place?  You're telling me all these images are
        USGS gravity anomaly maps of the contiguous US?
        <br><br>
        Hmm ... let me see that whole map again.
    </div>
    <div class="migDiv">
        <img src="rawAmerica.jpg" class="fullus">
        <a href="https://mrdata.usgs.gov/general/map-us.html">
        mrdata.usgs.gov/general/map-us.html</a>
        <br><br>
    </div>
    <div>
        Well, it looks like there's just <i>countless</i> places
        that could be interpreted as impact crater features.
        I mean to say is - how many of these did <i>you</i> see?
    </div>
    <div class="migDiv">
        <img src="circleAmerica.jpg" class="fullus">
    </div>
    <div>
        Now that you've had the circles pointed out, go back and
        look at the raw map again; tell me if you don't see all
        of those circles - or more.
    </div>
    <div>
        So, do you think you could find one of these in really
        any size you'd like? Or need? Or that would fit with
        your predictions?  What if you wanted to find one that
        <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/doubts-on-dinosaurs/">to date,
        no one has found iridium associated with</a>? What about
        one that has been?

        When paleontologists see a million acres of grassland,
        destroyed by wildfire, they look for a <i>million-acre-wide
        asteroid</i>, instead of the cigarette that caused it.
